This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## What to Know Before I Get Started?

rmstale is intended to be a small, lightweight tool, intended to work cross-platform. Changes that only work on a single platform will be accepted, as long as they do not break functionality on other platforms.
The tool is designed to be a command-line application, without a user interface. Changes that introduce new user interfaces will also be approved as long as they do not break command-line functionality.
